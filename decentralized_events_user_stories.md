# Decentralized Events User Stories

## Introduction

Decentralized events empower artists, venues, sponsors, and other contributors by enabling fair compensation without intermediaries. Leveraging blockchain technology, event organizers can create smart contracts on the platform, allowing contributors to lock in SOL tokens as a commitment to the event. Post-event, attendees vote on the event's success and contributors' performance, determining payouts based on these evaluations.
